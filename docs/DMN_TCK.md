# DMN TCK

The [DMN standard](https://www.omg.org/dmn/) defines the FEEL language and the [DMN TCK](https://github.com/dmn-tck/tck) offers a helpful vendor agnostic testbed for verifying standard conformance. 

This library is [automatically tested](https://github.com/nikku/feelin/actions/workflows/DMN_TCK.yml) against the FEEL related [DMN TCK](https://github.com/dmn-tck/tck) tests. 
Known issues are tagged via the [`tck` label](https://github.com/nikku/feelin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atck).
